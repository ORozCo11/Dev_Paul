     * Final stabilization — a barangay's `boundary` was a bare "set or not"
     * boolean (`has_boundary`). This gives it a real status a Super Admin can
     * trust: VERIFIED (explicitly confirmed), NOT FOUND (the public geocoder
     * never produced a usable match), or null (never attempted). A found-but-
     * not-yet-reviewed match lands in `pending_boundary` instead of
     * `boundary` directly — "NEEDS REVIEW" is derived from its presence, not
     * its own stored state, so there's exactly one place a boundary is ever
     * "live" (boundary) and one place it's "proposed" (pending_boundary).
