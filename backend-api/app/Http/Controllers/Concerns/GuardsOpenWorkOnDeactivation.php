/**
 * VMS-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md Phase B5 — deactivating a user today only flips
 * is_active and revokes tokens; it never touches anything they were
 * assigned to. The only "unstick" tools are reassignCustodian()/
 * reassignMechanic() (TicketController) and reassignSchedule() (below) —
 * none of them fire automatically, so an Admin who deactivates someone
 * with open work has to notice and fix it by hand, after the fact. This
 * guard forces that reassignment to happen FIRST, before the account goes
 * inactive, by returning exactly what's still open and blocking until it
 * isn't. Shared by UserController (an Admin acting on their own barangay)
 * and SuperAdminController (a Super Admin acting across every barangay).
 *
 * Deliberately NOT covering "custodian of a vehicle" — that's a Phase D11
 * concept (a persistent vehicle -> custodian column) that doesn't exist in
 * the schema yet; extend this guard when that column lands.
