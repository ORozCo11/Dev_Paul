     * Public self-registration. Residents/staff sign up naming their own
     * barangay, but the account is created inactive — an Admin must approve
     * (activate) it via the existing Users management screen before it can
     * log in, the same gate `login()` already enforces for any deactivated
     * account.
     *
     * Barangays are independent tenants (see BelongsToBarangay/
     * ScopedThroughVehicle) — every barangay gets its own bootstrap, not
     * just the very first account system-wide:
     * - The first account to register under a GIVEN barangay becomes that
     *   barangay's Admin immediately, active, no approval needed — there's
     *   nobody else there yet who could review them. This can happen once
     *   per barangay, whenever it happens to get its first registrant.
     * - Everyone registering under a barangay — first person included —
     *   must supply THAT barangay's own Staff Registration Code. Without
     *   this, anyone could just claim to be "first" for a real barangay
     *   whose Admin seat happens to still be empty and become its Admin
     *   uncontested. The code for every real, pre-seeded barangay is
     *   generated ahead of time (see BarangaySeeder) and handed to that
     *   barangay's office outside the app, so only someone who actually
     *   went through that office can ever complete this step.
