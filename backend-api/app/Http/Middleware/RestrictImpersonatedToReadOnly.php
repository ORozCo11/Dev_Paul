 * VMS-IMPROVEMENT-PLAN.md Phase A5 — impersonation is for looking at an
 * account to support or recover it, never for acting as it. A token
 * carrying the 'impersonated' ability (see AuthController::impersonate())
 * may only read: every GET/HEAD/OPTIONS request passes through untouched,
 * every other verb is rejected outright — except ending the session itself
 * (logout — including Workspace.jsx's "Return to..." control, which calls
 * it before swapping back to the real account) and switching to a
 * different impersonated account (impersonate/*), both of which are about
 * the impersonation session, not the impersonated account's own data.
