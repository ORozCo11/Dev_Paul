/**
 * Runs daily (see routes/console.php). A Scheduled maintenance entry whose
 * date has arrived becomes a ticket PROPOSAL automatically, instead of
 * relying on someone noticing and converting it by hand.
 *
 * Production-readiness audit finding #1 — this used to create the ticket
 * directly as Active, with its sub-issue pre-assigned to a mechanic,
 * completely bypassing Admin review, the human proposeTicket() path's
 * duplicate-title guard, and the subissue.assign_mechanic ability. That's
 * fixed here: a due schedule now produces a 'Pending Approval' proposal —
 * identical in every respect to a Custodian manually proposing one — that
 * still has to go through the normal approveTicket()/declineTicket() review.
 * Any schedule's suggested mechanic rides along as `suggested_mechanic_id`
 * (a suggestion only, same as a human proposal) rather than being dispatched
 * directly; approveTicket() is what actually assigns them, exactly as it
 * already does for a Custodian's own proposals.
 *
 * `resulting_ticket_id` is stamped once a proposal is created, which is also
 * what stops this command from converting the same schedule twice on
 * consecutive days if it's ever left un-reviewed past its date.
 *
 * Deliberately does NOT touch completeSchedule()'s existing standalone
 * behavior — a schedule with a resulting_ticket_id set is expected to be
 * finished by closing that TICKET, not by completing the schedule row
 * directly; completeSchedule() itself is guarded against double-completion
 * once a ticket exists (see FleetController::completeSchedule).
