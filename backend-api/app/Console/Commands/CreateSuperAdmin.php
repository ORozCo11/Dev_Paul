/**
 * The only supported way to provision a real Super Admin account outside
 * local/testing. 2026_08_31_000001_create_super_admin_account.php seeds a
 * demo one, but is deliberately gated to local/testing only — a well-known
 * email+password for an account that can see every barangay's accounts
 * must never be auto-created on a real deployment (see that migration's
 * docblock, and database/seeders/UserSeeder.php which is gated the same
 * way as of this command's introduction).
 *
 * Prompts interactively for everything rather than taking flags, so a
 * password never ends up in shell history or a deploy script's logs.
 * Not scoped to any barangay (barangay_id stays null) — see
 * SuperAdminController and BelongsToBarangay's docblock for why that's
 * what lets a Super Admin see across every barangay.
